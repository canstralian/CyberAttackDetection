# **Canstralian/CyberAttackDetection - AI Model Overview**

## **Model Description**
**CyberAttackDetection** is a cutting-edge machine learning model designed to detect and classify a wide range of cyberattacks in real-time. Built using advanced algorithms and a comprehensive dataset of known attack signatures, the model can effectively identify abnormal behaviors, intrusion attempts, and potential threats in network traffic and system logs.

The model is optimized for high accuracy and low latency, making it ideal for use in real-time network monitoring, incident response, and security operations centers. By leveraging **WhiteRabbitNeo** (based on Llama-3.1), it offers high adaptability to new attack vectors and ensures robust protection against both common and sophisticated threats.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time detection and classification of cyberattacks
- Identification of vulnerabilities and exploits, including zero-day attacks
- Adaptive learning capabilities to recognize new threats
- High accuracy and low false-positive rates
- Scalable for deployment in diverse environments, from small businesses to large enterprises

This model is tailored for penetration testers, cybersecurity professionals, and organizations looking to enhance their security posture with AI-powered attack detection.

## **Topics Covered in Cyberattack Detection**
The **CyberAttackDetection** model helps identify vulnerabilities that attackers commonly exploit, including but not limited to:

- **Open Ports:** Identifying entry points like HTTP (80, 443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and SMB (445).
- **Outdated Software:** Vulnerabilities arising from outdated systems and third-party services.
- **Default Credentials:** Risks posed by common factory-installed usernames and passwords.
- **Misconfigurations:** Insecure service configurations that can open up attack vectors.
- **Injection Flaws:** Common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and command injections.
- **Unencrypted Services:** Identifying services without encryption (e.g., HTTP vs HTTPS).
- **Known Software Vulnerabilities:** Checking for outdated software vulnerabilities using resources like the NVD or tools like Nessus and OpenVAS.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Unauthorized command transmission in web apps.
- **API Vulnerabilities:** Detecting insecure API endpoints and data leakage.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Identifying DoS vulnerabilities that impact system availability.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Identifying vulnerabilities that expose personal or financial data.

## Uses

### Direct Use

This model can be used directly for detecting cyber attacks by analyzing network traffic or system logs. It is especially useful for network administrators and cybersecurity experts who need real-time or historical analysis of potentially malicious activities.

### Downstream Use [optional]

The model can be fine-tuned further for specific types of cyber attacks or to suit different environments (e.g., enterprise networks, small businesses). It can also be integrated into larger security ecosystems that perform continuous monitoring and threat analysis.

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model is not intended for detecting non-cyber attacks or for use outside cybersecurity applications. It may not perform well with highly specialized or obscure types of attacks that are not well-represented in the training data.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model’s performance is influenced by the quality and diversity of the training data. Misclassifications may occur, particularly when encountering novel attack patterns or environments not well-represented in the dataset. Furthermore, the model may generate false positives or miss complex attack vectors.

### Recommendations

Users should regularly update the model with new data and threat intelligence to keep it relevant. The model should be used in conjunction with human oversight and other detection mechanisms to minimize the risk of undetected threats.

## How to Get Started with the Model

To get started with the model, use the following code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

model = pipeline("cyber_attack_detection", model="Canstralian/CyberAttackDetection")
