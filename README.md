# Model Card for Canstralian/CyberAttackDetection

This modelcard aims to be a base template for new models. It has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md?plain=1).

## Model Details

### Model Description

This model is designed for detecting cyber attacks, focusing on identifying patterns of malicious activities in network traffic or system logs. It can help automate the detection of various types of cyber attacks in real-time or in post-event analysis, enhancing cybersecurity measures and incident response.

## Uses

### Direct Use

This model can be used directly for detecting cyber attacks by analyzing network traffic or system logs. It can be deployed as part of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or as a stand-alone tool for security analysts.

### Downstream Use [optional]

The model can be fine-tuned further for specific types of cyber attacks or to suit different environments (e.g., enterprise networks, small businesses).

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model is not intended for detecting non-cyber attacks or for use outside cybersecurity applications. It may not perform well with highly specialized or obscure types of attacks.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model's performance depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the data it was trained on. In certain environments, it might produce false positives or miss novel attack patterns. It's also important to note that the model is trained on specific attack vectors and might not detect all possible threats.

### Recommendations

Users should monitor the model's performance and regularly update it with new attack patterns. It's recommended to use the model as part of a multi-layered cybersecurity strategy that includes human oversight.
